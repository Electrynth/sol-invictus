# Detailed Real‑World Foundations & Gameplay Roles for Each Faction

## Terran Legacy Directorate

| Real‑World / Physical Context | Design Decision for Faction | Gameplay Implications |
|---|---|---|
| Earth retains the Solar System’s largest population, diverse biosphere, and deep industrial heritage. | The Directorate frames itself as the cultural steward and regulator of 'human baseline' standards. | Grants the faction soft‑power leverage: passports, cultural IP rights, and baseline‑human medical services the player may need. |
| Low‑Earth orbit is already crowded with satellites and proposed megastructures (orbital rings, beanstalk clamps). | Directorate fields layered defense grids and orbital customs stations. | Travelling through Terran space triggers tariff checks, smuggling minigames, or escort licenses. |
| The Moon offers proven regolith shielding and line‑of‑sight to every Earth ground station every 28 hours. | Luna hosts veteran shipyards producing tried‑and‑true hulls but slow to adopt bleeding‑edge tech. | Players seeking reliability & spare parts favor Directorate vendors; innovation seekers look elsewhere. |
| Earth’s deep gravity well makes heavy lift costly. | Directorate taxes interplanetary launches, motivating fringe factions to develop loopholes (mass driver relays, Lagrange piracy). | Story arcs revolve around evading or lobbying against these tariffs. |

**Putting it all together**

- The Directorate embodies stability and bureaucracy—use it as the benchmark faction players love or rebel against.
- Mechanically, they gate entry‑level licenses, enforce tariffs, and offer the safest but slowest ship upgrades.
